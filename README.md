# Web Page Fetcher CLI

A command-line tool to fetch and display web page content, with form submission capabilities and AI-powered question answering.

This is my project developed during the AI Devs 3 course in which I was a participant.
More about AI Devs 3 [here](https://www.aidevs.pl/).

This is entirely created by me and my AI assistants. 🤖🚀

This is my first project in Deno. Why? For fun and learning.

## Features

- Fetch web page content from provided URL
- Extract form questions and submit answers
- AI-powered question answering using Anthropic AI SDK (at the moment)
- Handle login forms with credentials from environment variables
- Error handling for invalid URLs and network issues

Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```bash
USERNAME=your_username
