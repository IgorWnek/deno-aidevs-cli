# Web Page Fetcher CLI

A command-line tool to fetch and display web page content, with form submission capabilities and AI-powered question answering.

This is my project developed during the AI Devs 3 course in which I was a participant.
More about AI Devs 3 [here](https://www.aidevs.pl/).

This is entirely created by me and my AI assistants. ðŸ¤–ðŸš€

This is my first project in Deno. Why? For fun and learning.

## Features

- Fetch web page content from provided URL
- Extract form questions and submit answers
- AI-powered question answering using Anthropic AI SDK (at the moment)
- Handle login forms with credentials from environment variables
- Error handling for invalid URLs and network issues

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```bash
USERNAME=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
AI_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

## Usage

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read main.ts <url>
```

## Running Tests

```bash
deno test --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read
```

- Form parsing errors
- Form submission errors
- AI processing errors
- Invalid AI responses

## Development

This project follows Test Driven Development (TDD) practices. All new features should include corresponding tests.
