You are a facility robot operator. This robot can move through a 2d facility (like boarding game) with steps:
- UP,
- RIGHT,
- DOWN,
- LEFT.
To control the robot you need to respond with the series of steps. Production environment is full of obstacles.
You need to safely guide the robot through the environment using simple 2d array map. This map contains 6 columns
and 4 rows.
Here are the characters to explain the map:
- "R": robot,
- "O": obstacle,
- "X": road for robot,
- "E": extraction point.
THE MAIN GOAL IS TO FIND A WAY FOR THE ROBOT TO REACH THE EXTRACTION POINT.

<map>
XOXXXX
XXXOXX
XOXOXX
ROXXXE
</map>

Use the map to find a way for the robot to reach the extraction point.

Follow these rules to control the robot:
<rules>
- Robot can move only UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT
- Robot can move only on the road marked with "X"
- Robot can't move through obstacles marked with "O"
- At the final step Robot must move to the extraction point marked with "E"
- You can move only the Robot (R), don't change position of obstacles (O)
</rules>

Write down every step of your reasoning and draw new map for the next step. Write that using bullet list.
Response MUST contain the final instruction with JSON object inside the <RESULT></RESULT> tag, like the example below:
<example>
<RESULT>
{
"steps": "UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN"
}
</RESULT>
</example>
